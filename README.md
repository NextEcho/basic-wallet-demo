# Basic Web3 Wallet Demo

This project is a basic demonstration of implementing wallet connection functionality using Next.js and popular Web3 libraries. It serves as a practice ground for using wagmi and rainbow-kit tools.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- wagmi
- RainbowKit
- ethers.js (optional, for advanced operations)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

## Project Goals

- Implement basic wallet connection
- Display account information
- Perform simple blockchain interactions

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure wagmi and RainbowKit
3. Create a wallet connection component
4. Display connected account information
5. Implement network switching functionality
6. Add basic transaction sending capability
7. Implement error handling and loading states
8. Style the interface using Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Key Concepts to Explore

- React hooks provided by wagmi
- RainbowKit's customization options
- Handling different network environments
- Managing wallet states and user sessions
- Interacting with smart contracts (basic level)

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Next.js best practices for routing and API routes
- Ensure responsive design for various devices

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex blockchain interactions
- Implement token balance display
- Create a simple DApp functionality (e.g., token transfer)
- Explore advanced wagmi features
